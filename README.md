🚀 Introducing Camerashake_helper for Foundry Nuke! 🚀

I'm thrilled to share a new tool I've developed: Camerashake_helper for Foundry Nuke. This gizmo leverages 31 practical camera shake presets from ActionVFX, providing artists with a powerful and versatile way to add realistic camera shake to their projects.

With Camerashake_helper, you can:
🎥 Adjust speed, rotation, translation, and scale of the camera shake animations.
🔄 Utilize loop animations for seamless effects.
🕒 Customize the frame range to fit your specific needs.
